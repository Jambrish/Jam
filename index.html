    <p>
        <br>I asked her to stay
        <br>But she wouldn't listen
        <br> And she left before I had the chance to say, oh
        <br>The words that would mend
        <br>The things that were broken
        <br>But now it's far too late, she's gone away
        <p>
            <br>Every night you cry yourself to sleep
            <br>Thinking: "Why does this happen to me?
            <br>Why does every moment have to be so hard?"
            <br>Hard to believe that
            
            <p>
                <br>It's not over tonight
                <br>Just give me one more chance to make it right
                <br>I may not make it through the night
                <br>I won't go home without you
                
                <p>
                    <br>The taste of her breath
                    <br>I'll never get over
                    <br>The noises that you made kept me awake
                    <br>The weight of the things that remained unspoken
                    <br>Built up so much it crushed us everyday

                    <p>
                        <br>Every night you cry yourself to sleep
                        <br>Thinking: "Why does this happen to me?
                        <br>Why does every moment have to be so hard?"
                        <br>Hard to believe that
                       
                       
                        <p>
                            <br> It's not over tonight
                            <br>Just give me one more chance to make it right
                            <br>I may not make it through the night
                            <br>I won't go home without you
                           
                            <p>
                                <br>It's not over tonight
                                <br>Just give me one more chance to make it right
                                <br>I may not make it through the night
                                <br>I won't go home without you

                                    <p>
                                        <br>Of all the things I felt but never really shown
                                        <br>Perhaps the worst is that I ever let you go
                                        <br>I should not ever let you go, oh, oh, oh
